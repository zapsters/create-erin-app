## Create-Erin-App

A cli-tool module utilizing built in (core) modules made for my N320 class, Intermediate Application Development.

Modules used:

- readline
- fs
- path

## Weekly Recap

This week we learned multiple built in node modules and applied them in a few ways. Using readline we are able to get user input in the terminal. Using path, we are able to construct paths, typically relative to the active file / active working area. Path combined with also using filesystem (fs), we were able to create directories and create files at specific paths on the system.

We also have been introduced to OOP, object oriented programming, providing a modular way to handle duplicate instances.

## Module Guide

Create-Erin-App can be used by

- running `npx create-erin-app`
- installing the package globally with `npm install create-erin-app -g` and running `create-erin-app`

This module will create a simple app setup with a custom name. When ran, it will

- Ask for project name and create a directory under that name at the active working area. Under this project folder, it will create:
  - A dist subdirectory
  - An src subdirectory
  - An index.js
  - A readme.md
- Also, as a little bonus, you will have the option to add a special gift to your directory. ⊂◉‿◉ つ
